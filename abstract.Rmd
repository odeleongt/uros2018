Although several technical standards are available regarding the preparation and
dissemination of official statistics, entities producing these data will
sometimes export it in formats native to the variety of tools they use for data
management and analysis, and then publish these datasets in _ad hoc_ web portals
not necessarily well suited for data consumption by statistical tools like R.
Even if the data are available in one of the more common file formats
(_e.g._ SAS, SPSS, or Stata data files, and even Excel spreadsheets),
the web portals can prove difficult to even navigate in a web browser,
let alone use them as repositories for more automated data access.

The Guatemalan National Institute of Statistics (**INE**) provides several official
data resources through a web portal roughly arranged by categories and time
periods (https://www.ine.gob.gt/index.php/estadisticas/fuente-base-de-datos,
web site in Spanish), but the available datasets are not clearly documented and
are typically discovered through manual browsing of the site.
Once a user finds a dataset of interest to her, it is implied by the context
which format was used to export the data, and no additional instructions on how
to use the data are provided.

This work presents the overall structure of the INE data portal and showcases
the `nsgtm` (National Statistics - Guatemala) R package, which allows users to
explore the available **INE** datasets within R and download them directly for
use in an R session.
As a motivating example, the package is used to find and load the
official birth records from 2010-2015, which are spread across
several pages.
